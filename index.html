        <p id="changeText2">Dyslexia is characterized by difficulty in learning to read fluently and with inaccurate comprehension despite normal intelligence. Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, sounding out words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.</p>
        <p  id="changeText3">Some see dyslexia as distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or from poor or inadequate reading instruction. There are three proposed cognitive subtypes of dyslexia, although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by specific underlying neuropsychological deficits and co-occurring learning disabilities. Although it is considered to be a receptive language-based learning disability in the research literature, dyslexia also affects one's expressive language skills. Researchers at MIT found that people with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition abilities.</p>
